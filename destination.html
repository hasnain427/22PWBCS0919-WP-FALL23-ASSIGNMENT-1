        <h1>Places To Visit In Swat</h1>
        <p style="font-size: medium; color: white;">Swat, often called the "Switzerland of Pakistan," is a beautiful region with a rich cultural and natural heritage.
             There are several places to visit in Swat, along with some important precautions to keep in mind while traveling there:</p>
              
             <ul>
                <li>Mingora</li>
                <p>This is the largest city in Swat and serves as a gateway to other attractions in the region. You can explore
                     the local bazaars and markets to experience the local culture.</p>

                <li>Malam Jabba</li>
                <p> Known for its ski resort, Malam Jabba is also a picturesque spot in the winter. In the summer, the lush landscapes are perfect for hiking.</p>

                <li>Madyan And Bahrain</li>
                <p>These two small towns offer a glimpse of Swat's culture and are known for their riverside settings. You can also shop for local handicrafts in the markets.</p>

                <h1 style="color: red;">Precautions</h1>
            <ul>

                <li>Respect Local Customs:</li>
                <p>Swat has a conservative culture, so it's important to dress modestly and respect local customs and traditions.</p>

                <li>Stay Hydrated:</li>
                <p>The region can get quite hot in the summer, so carry enough water to stay hydrated.</p>

                <li>Travel in Daylight:</li>
